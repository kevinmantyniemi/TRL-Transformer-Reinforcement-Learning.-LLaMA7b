"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: At the bottom of the River, a review by Dylan Review: At the Bottom of the river isn't, in my perspective, a very good book. I gave it one star. I gave it one star because there isn't really a plot, main character (at least with a name), and it is boring. The book is sort of written in a mix between the first person and third person perspectives. The book is hard to understand, especially with 2 two page long sentences! The book kind of seems like it is someone thinking, with no real reason. It skips from one place to another in one chapter. It is hard to get into the story, and since there is no plot, there is little suspense. All in all, it isn't a very good book, and I don't recommend it. Answer:

I agree it did not get a fair shake, just like SHARK of a few years ago. Same network. Now it appears that the boys at CBS are just as unfair to the fans regarding the DVD release. I guess CBS feels that it is only right to make the fans of this show suffer more by paying more for this series than other CBS releases on DVD. They are charging 30% for this release and for fewer episodes. I see that Blue Bloods and Hawaii ZERO (sorry Five O - I was thinking of quality) are priced at $ 38 while Defenders is $ 50.

"Answer the following question: Title: 3 Cups??? Review: This coffee press does what it is supposed to do, for the most part. You can make coffee with it, but I have concerns about the measuring device(s) used to get 3 Cups. When I opened the package, I couldn't imagine three cups of coffee came from such a tiny press. So, I measured the pour and only 1 cup of coffee came out (1 US cup = 236.588237 milliliters). Since it is a ""one cup at a time"" press, do I only get three full cups and then have to throw it away and order another? The instructions do not tell you how to obtain three cups of coffee from this press. The instructions outside say use 3 scoops of coffee grounds. The instructions inside say to use 1 scoop (per cup). I measured only one cup, but the box says 3 cups. Do I use old grounds to get my next two cups? Ew... So, how did the manufacturer get three cups?? I was expecting a press that made three cups of coffee in one brew. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

This was a huge disappointment with very little information regarding digestion and explained in very dumbed down terms.

I try to avoid washing dishes by hand as much as possible, so it's a big minus as far as I'm concerned. In addition, I'm not sure how well the pink ""leather"" will behave with warm water and soap. I guess I'll have to find out, b/c I don't want to pay $5.5 return costs, so I'll keep it.For those who don't care about the dishwashing part the mug seems to be well made; it's very aesthetic and feminine.The part where you can sip your beverage from any part of the rim is very nice as well.If I could remove the leather wrap before washing it (like I did with my previous mug), I would have given it 4 stars.

I had to buy a new passenger blade but was able to straighten out the driver blade. After this I am finished with rainx blades. It was very loud and startling and appeared to happen for no reason.

Review title: Entertaining Entry into the Series Product review: This second ""Eerie"" novel by John Peel (the famous UK DJ??? OK, probably not) is a vast improvement on ""Burea of Lost"" (Eerie #2). The story is witty, fast paced, entertaining and, for once, not modelled after an episode from the TV show.One complaint: For a series that I've noted before as being incredibly faithful to its source material, I was disappointed to see that Peel got one detail wrong here. Dash is identified at one point as ""Dash Check"" whe in the series his name was ""Dash X"" (he got his name from the markings on his hand which read X and -).

The hip flexors are important muscles that are in involved in doing a front split.  These muscles will need to be gradually trained to become more flexible before you can do a full front split.  Try this basic stretch to increase the flexibility of your hip flexors.  Get down on both of your knees. Put one leg out in front of you, placing your foot on the floor and your knee at a ninety degree angle. Gently lean forward towards your outstretched leg.  Keep your body and hips straight as you stretch forward. You'll feel the stretch in your thigh of the leg you are kneeling on. Hold this position for about 30 seconds. Repeat the motion on the other leg. Another set of muscles that are involved in front stretches are the quadriceps.  Stretching your quadriceps will allow the leg that will be behind you to comfortably move into the front split position. Try this basic stretch to build up flexibility in your quadriceps and work towards the full front split:  Stand upright and straight.  You may want to stand next to a chair that you can grab onto for stability. Bend one leg at the knee, grab the ankle and bring the foot up behind you.

Afterwards, he is demoted from editor-in-chief of a publishing house when it is taken over by tycoon Raymond Alden, who replaces him with Will's protÃ©gÃ© Stewart Swinton who had begged Alden for the job behind Will's back. When Will thinks that his wife Charlotte is having an affair with Stewart, after smelling his scent on her clothes, he rushes over to his house where Stewart sees Will angry and asks him what the problem is. Will bites Stewart on the hand while entering into the building and rushes upstairs to the room to find Charlotte half-naked. His worst fears are confirmed and he leaves without saying a word. Will becomes more aggressive, taking on the characteristics of a wolf. With the help of Alden's headstrong daughter Laura, Will sets out for his new life. His first escapade as a werewolf takes place at Laura's estate, where he wakes up at night and hunts down a deer. In the morning, Will finds himself on the bank of a stream, with blood all over his face and hands. He visits Dr. Vijav Alezais, who gives him an amulet to protect him from turning completely into a wolf. Alezais asks Will to bite him, as Alezais does not have long to live and would prefer ""demonization to death"". After refusing, Will keeps the amulet so that he will not transform at the next full moon. Calling Laura to explain, Will, now a werewolf, breaks into the zoo and steals handcuffs from a policeman.

"Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

"In this task you will be given a list of integers. For every element in the list, if the element is even you should divide by 4, if the element is odd you should multiply by 4 then add 2. The output should be a list of numbers that is the result of applying that logic to the input list. You should not round any decimals in the output. Zero should be counted as an even integer.

Let me give you an example: [5, 8, 9, 3, 7]
The answer to this example can be: [22, 2.0, 38, 14, 30]
Here is why: The odd numbers, 5, 9, 3, and 7 were multiplied by 4 then added 2. The even number eight was divided by 4.

"I went online to check if my pay was in my bank account . To my amazement I discovered that not only had I been paid, a company I'd never worked for had also paid me! I know I'd have been beside myself if my own salary was not in my account, so I tried to get the money back to the right person. Easier said than done.                 The bank couldn't help as it ""wasn't a bank problem."" The human-resource department at the company that paid me was unable to help as I didn't have enough details. I rang the bank again. Thankfully I had a sympathetic  call operator who gave me a name, so I again rang the company ""Daniel"" worked for.                  I expected the bank would get in touch with me to arrange to take the money from my account and repay Daniel. I heard nothing for a month and the money remained in my account when Daniel called, explaining he'd tried to get back his money but had been unsuccessful as neither the bank nor his company felt it was their error. He had rung to ask if I could speak to the bank, but after chatting for a few minutes we realized we could probably fix this problem ourselves.                 We decided I would take the money from my account and he would pick it up from me. Due to my busy job I was unable to meet Daniel personally but he left me a lovely bottle of wine in exchange for what was rightfully his. I never had any intention of keeping Daniel's pay but red tape  made it difficult to do the right thing. It all came down to two people being able to do what a huge bank and a large company couldn't do -- admit a mistake had occurred and fix it. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? A) Daniel had been repaid when he called the author. B) The author was to blame as he didn't have enough details. C) Neither the bank nor the company admitted their fault.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?
Step-by-step reasoning process: The discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1. So the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1 / gallon x 3 gallons = $3. The total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1 / box x 5 boxes = $5. You will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.
The answer is 8.

Answer the following question.
Rose had 10 kilograms of rice. She cooked 9/10 kilograms in the morning and 1/4 of the remaining in the evening. How many grams of rice did she have left?
Step-by-step reasoning process: Rose cooked 10 x 9 / 10 = 9 kilograms of rice in the morning. She had 10 - 9 = 1 kilogram of rice left then. One kilogram is equal to 1 x 1000 = 1000 grams. So, Rose cooked 1000 x 1 / 4 = 250 grams of rice in the evening. Therefore, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 grams of rice left.
The answer is 750.

Rosie runs 6 miles per hour. She runs for 1 hour on Monday, 30 minutes on Tuesday, 1 hour on Wednesday, and 20 minutes on Thursday. If she wants to run 20 miles for the week, how many minutes should she run on Friday?
Step-by-step reasoning process: On Monday and Wednesday, Rosie runs 6 * 1 = 6 miles. On Tuesday, Rosie runs 6 * (30 minutes / 60 minutes) = 3 miles. On Thursday, Rosie runs 6 * (20 minutes / 60 minutes) = 2 miles. So far this week Rosie has run 6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 miles. To reach her goal, she must run 20 - 17 = 3 miles on Friday. Thus, she should run for 6 / 3 = .5 hour which is 30 minutes.
The answer is 30.

Paragraph: The study to be published on Wednesday in the Journal of Neuroscience differs from many other pot-related research projects that are focused on chronic, heavy users of cannabis. The collaborative effort between Northwestern University’s medical school, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School showed a direct correlation between the number of times users smoked and abnormalities in the brain. “What we’re seeing is changes in people who are 18 to 25 in core brain regions that you never, ever want to fool around with,” said co-senior study author Dr. Hans Beiter, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University. In particular, the study identified changes to the nucleus accumbens and the nucleus amygdala, regions of the brain that are key to regulating emotion and motivation, in marijuana users who smoke between one and seven joints a week. The researchers found changes to the volume, shape and density of those brain regions. But more studies are needed to determine how those changes may have long-term consequences and whether they can be fixed with abstinence, Beiter said. “Our hypothesis from this early work is that these changes may be an early sign of what later becomes amotivation, where people aren’t focused on their goals,” he said. The study, which was funded in part by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, comes as access to pot is expanding following 2012 votes in Washington state and Colorado to legalize its recreational use. The drug remains illegal under federal law. Medical pot is allowed in 20 U.S. states. Pot legalization advocates make the argument that marijuana is safer than alcohol a central part of their campaigns. Other research has found drinking alcohol alters the brain, Beiter said. But while researchers do not know exactly how the mental rewiring seen in pot users affects their lives, the study shows it physically changes the brain in ways that differ from drinking, he said. This latest study fits with other research showing marijuana use has significant effects on young people because their brains are still developing, and Beiter said he has become convinced that marijuana should only be used by people under 30 if they need it to manage pain from a terminal illness. Claim: Casual pot use causes brain abnormalities in the young: study.

Movie title: Spider-Man 2 Context: Peter Parker is finding his double life increasingly difficult. Precariously struggling to balance his crime-fighting duties with the demands of his normal life, Peter often finds his personal life taking a back seat. He loses a job, faces financial difficulties, and struggles to maintain his physics studies at Columbia University. Moreover, he has become estranged from both love interest Mary Jane, who to Peter's disappointment is in a relationship, and best friend Harry Osborn who falsely accuses Spider-Man of murdering his father, and Aunt May is threatened with foreclosure.Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, has invested in the research of brilliant scientist Otto Octavius, Peter's idol. To perform a sustained fusion experiment, Octavius has developed a set of artificially intelligent mechanical arms, which are impervious to heat and magnetism. Though the experiment overloads and becomes unstable, Dr. Octavius refuses to halt it, with devastating results: his wife is killed; the neural inhibitor chip which prevented the advanced AI of the arms from influencing Octavius's own mind is destroyed; and the arms are fused to his spine. Unconscious, he is taken to a hospital to have the appendages removed, but the tentacles develop their own ability to move at will and brutally kill the surgeons, and Octavius escapes. Uncontrolled, the tentacles begin to corrupt Octavius' mind, playing on his vanity and ego, and he decides he must complete his experiment at any cost. J. Jonah Jameson names him ""Doctor Octopus"" or ""Doc Ock"". In an effort to finance his experiments, Doc Ock attempts to rob a bank where Peter Parker and his Aunt May happen to be present. After a short glitch in his powers, Spider-Man manages to recover and soon the two take their fight outside the bank, but Doc Ock takes Aunt May as a hostage. When Spider-Man rescues her, she revises her former opinion of him and realizes that he is a hero. Octavius escapes unharmed.During a party, Peter learns that M.J. is planning to marry J. Jonah...

Verizon was able to transfer contacts from old phone and we activated it over the air without difficulty (couldn't activate it on-line - not sure why, probably due to the age of the phone[?]). The only glitch has been a message ""Phone number has recently changed, please enter PIN"" that appeared a couple of times but did not effect the phones operation.

I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the ""story line."" Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own.

I found it to be very demeaning for her housekeeper to talk like she did, and to hover over Miss Julia in such a demeaning way (to the housekeeper.)Also, one irritating thing that occurs in the book and in my opinion takes up a large portion of the book as filler is:Something happens, then Miss Julia or another character repeats itto several other characters.The first few times I thought it was maybe a device that would be rare, but I noticed it was done throughout the book many times.

Reverend Wayne Dulson has outraged neighbours after having bodies exhumed to make way for his new family home next to Loughton Baptist Church. A vicar has outraged neighbours after having bodies exhumed to make way for his new family home next to the church. Residents, including children, watched as bones from resting places pre-dating 1860 were dug up and transferred to coffins before being taken away. They say they are disgusted at the Reverend Wayne Dulson and Loughton Baptist Church’s lack of sensitivity over the matter and claim the move is motivated by money. The locals claim a perfectly good four-bedroom manse not far from the Essex church was sold last year for £630,000 to fund the project and the new one could be worth over £1million when complete. Underwriter Colin Hart, 50, whose family home backs on to the church, said: ‘I’m disgusted that a supposed man of the cloth should go round digging up bodies from their final place of rest. Local people have entrusted their loved ones to this church and this is how they behave.’ His wife, Julie, 48, added: ‘Whatever happened to rest in peace? We woke up to the sound of a JCB out the back and you could see them loading coffins from the back garden.’ Mother-of-four Simone Cohen, 52, said: ‘What I found most upsetting was that when they transferred the bones into coffins, the children could see everything.’ The row began after the church was given permission to develop the site. Epping Forest Council approved an extension for a playgroup at the church but turned down plans for the house because it was not in keeping with the area. This, however, was overturned on appeal to the planning inspectorate. Residents, including children, watched as bones from resting places pre-dating 1860 were dug up and transferred into coffins before being taken away. Neighbours were woken at 5am in October 2013 by the sound of workmen and a JCB which spent two weeks removing 25 bodies, including women buried with children, to make way for the nursery. An exhumation licence had been granted by the Ministry of Justice and the project was completed in spring. Work began on the house but it was suspended after more bodies were found and another licence sought. Mr Dulson, a married father, has declined to comment on the matter. But the church said in a statement it was investing £550,000 to ‘serve the community’ and was ‘saddened by any offence’ it had caused. It added: ‘We have worked with the Ministry of Justice and the local environmental health officer and followed their guidelines to the letter.’

You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation   of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China. During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified  . Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund. * Work Ethic The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business.

Plot title: Mother and Son Movie plot: ""Mother and Son"" (1997) is a love story, not of the ""Romeo and Juliette"" or ""Tristan and Isolde"" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. ""Mother and Son"" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by ""Father and Son"" (2003), and by ""Two Brothers and a Sister,"" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous ski of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the worldThey return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed, which now seems to resemble a coffin. Both know that the end is nearing, although he tries to reassure...

A: I really love this place.  I wasn't sure about the absence of a casino, but it was actually nice to come back to a calm, quiet building after a long night.  It's a really short walk to Aria and Bellagio, so I never felt too far from the action.  We stayed on the 11th floor with a pool view and found it really hard to sleep once the music started playing at the pool at 8am.  It didn't seem like it would be a problem, but it was actually pretty loud.  I really liked the kitchenette - we didn't cook anything but I liked having an empty fridge for water.    The pool was really great.  Not too fancy, but there were plenty of places to lay out or find shade if needed.  There were tons of staff walking around eager to help or take drink orders.    I was very happy with our decision to stay here and would recommend this hotel.

Q: negative

A: The building is nice, The rooms were cheap (one star). Your vallet staff and check-in staff are friendly (one star). Other than that, I HATE your staff that pull you at every turn to sign up for some stupid time share tour for reduced price tickets, we were talked into it just to find out the following day we didnt qualify financially, waste of my time! Your buffet is the worst restaurant ive ever been to, left hungry, and ended up sick. My room had a big giant crusty stain in the carpet. Handles and trim looked old, and it took room service at least 10 hours to get the dinner table from the hallway.Never staying there again!

Q: negative

A: This wasn't the worst place ever, but for the price I would never go back. For a soda, and iced tea and 2 meals we spent $45!!! I would totally pay about $7 for my Chimichanga...but not a penny more. My husband and I both got chimichangas- his was chicken and I got ground beef. There was flavor, but mostly of onion. Our meals both came with some cold, bland spanish rice and refried beans. We did get the free chips and salsa, but I've better of both in Denver. I'm not sure why everyone is so impressed that they are free. The waiter didn't even come back to see if our food was okay...instead he just stood around staring into space since we were his only table.

That's because Japanese children enter first year ofelementary school  in April following their sixth birthday. I started school when I was still five years old. In Japan, Children attend elementary school for six years, where they study Japanese, arithmetic, science, social studies, music, crafts, physical education, and home economics (simple cooking and sewing skills). During their three years in middle school, English is added to this list. Most schools have access to computers and the Internet. The classes in my school seemed rather big to me, around 30 students in a typical high school class. We ate lunch in the classroom, instead of a cafeteria and enjoyed a healthy, nutritious meal prepared by the school or by a local ""school lunch centre"" instead of eating the same, dry sandwiches every day. I really like the Japanese interpretation of school lunches. I also enjoyed the field trips and activities. At Japanese schools, there are many school events during the year, such as field day when students compete in tug-of-war, field trips, and arts and cultural festivals.

Generate a positive review for a place I stumbled across this little shop in Old Town several months ago, and it has now become my favorite stop for gelato.  If you've never had gelato, it's Italian ice cream, with less air whipped into it and less cream than American ice cream.  The less cream part makes for a lower fat product (yeah!!), but you would never know it.  It is actually more dense and creamy than ice cream.  Where too soft ice cream seems to just drip and melt in a puddle, gelato gets a little gooey almost.    The shop is nothing fancy, but has superior gelato.   While there are some of the typical flavors you find in ice cream, there are many more interesting flavors like spumoni, tiramisu, green tea, limoncello and poppyseed, fresh ginger, and creme brulee to name only a few!  The shop also has a great selection of sorbetto (sorbet).  Try the blackberry cabernet for something unique.   There is also a sandwich menu and Italian coffee served, although I've never had reason to buy a sandwich.  I'm there for the gelato baby!  This shop is on the edge of the shopping in Old Town so parking is usually not a problem either.  If you've never had gelato, try it at least once.  I'm pretty sure you'll be back.

Ques: Title: Kite Flies High but Falls Quickly Review: This I would not even consider to be a ""movie"". Kite is basically 45 minutes long...but it is one of the best 45 minutes in animation. If you like jam packed actions and bizarre plot twists then this is your movie. Though the subject of child molestation is touche, it deals with it in not too bad of a manner. The main character is a girl, who is about 16 years old. After seeing her parents brutally murder, she is taken in by a Police Detective. The detective uses the girl to kill child molesters in the world and his job is to investigate the scene to cover up her tracks. He has a secret that he is not telling her and when she meets another teenage assasin...the truth becomes clear. Animation is fluid. The dubbed voices are actually not bad and the story is top notch.

To make matters worse, the vice-president in charge of operations, Alexander Throttle-bottom, has run off, making this the fourth vice-president that the operation has lost. Matters are further compounded when the site's assistant refuses to press the start button to activate the factory, or accept Spacely's offer for a promotion or raise.Using his secretarial computer, Spacely pegs George Jetson to be the new vice-president, sending George home to pack and tell his family. However, the news is met with with sadness, as the move will interfere with Jane's recycling program, Elroy's spaceball tournament, and Judy's date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo.Even so, the family manages to come together (with the exception of Judy who is sad about her missed date), and the family arrives at the 'Orbiting Ore Asteroid,' which not only houses the factory, but a shopping center and housing complex. The Jetsons meet their new neighbors, including Lucy-2, whose husband Rudy-2 works at the factory, and son Teddy-2 plays on the local spaceball team. They also meet the Furbolo family, including their mischievous daughter, Fergie.The next day, George arrives at work and meets Rudy-2.

"Noted author and social activist Howard Zinn died of a heart attack Wednesday while traveling, his daughter, Myla Kabat-Zinn, said. Zinn, author of ""A People's History of the United States,"" was 87. Kabat-Zinn said her father, who lived in Auburndale, Massachusetts,"" died while traveling in Santa Monica, California. ""A People's History of the United States,"" first published in 1980, tells a history not often in seen in other books -- from the perspective of those not in a seat of power. The book was the inspiration for a 2009 documentary, narrated by Zinn, called ""The People Speak."" The film highlighted people who spoke up for social change, according to the Web site of the History Channel, which aired the program. Zinn was a shipyard worker and Air Force bombardier before he went to college under the GI Bill and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University, according to his Web site. He taught at numerous universities, including Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, and Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. Kabat-Zinn said of her father that he lived a ""very full and exciting life"" and that there were many social issues that were very important to him. Above all, she said, her father believed that there is no ""just war."" Zinn's death on the day of President Obama's first State of the Union address was underscored by his contribution to a recently released special from The Nation magazine called ""Obama at One."" ""I've been searching hard for a highlight,"" he wrote. ""The only thing that comes close is some of Obama's rhetoric; I don't see any kind of a highlight in his actions and policies."" Zinn said he was not ""terribly disappointed because I didn't expect that much,"" noting that he has been ""a traditional Democratic president"" on foreign policy -- ""hardly any different from a Republican"" -- and has been cautious in domestic policy. ""On health care, for example, he starts out with a compromise, and when you start out with a compromise, you end with a compromise of a compromise, which is where we are now,"" Zinn said. Zinn also cautioned ""that Obama is going to be a mediocre president -- which means, in our time, a dangerous president -- unless there is some national movement to push him in a better direction.""

She seemed too mature to be only 15. Her smug confidence in her beauty and its power irritated me, as did her passive observations of so much around her.

However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line, mainly because of objections from cab operators to the type of tracks which – although they were laid to the Irish national railway gauge of 5 ft 3in – protruded from the road surface.[citation needed]

Question: During World War I, the palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.

It is your responsibility to find out what homework you have missed. It is not the teacher's job to remind you of missed homework. 3. You must not be absent  on a test day. If you are badly ill, call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows you to take a _ , you should take the test within one or two days after you return to class. Bad illness is the only reason for missing a test. 4. Be on time! It's not polite to be late. Also, it bothers other students. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Have your books out of your bag before you come into the classroom.

Title: Subdued performances Review: All the performances on here are pretty subdued; it seems that Elvis never really cuts loose a la ""Burning Love"" or ""Promised Land"" which is disappointing. While the title track ""Raised on Rock"" is ok, it leaves you wishing they had pumped it up a notch or two. That song seemed like it was tailor made to be an Elvis rocker, but they didn't let the guitars and drums really go and as a consequence Elvis never really takes off on the song. That seems to be the case for the entire album. ""Three Corn Patches"" a country / blues type song is the only song I found really interesting. Overall, I was expecting more from this album but was disappointed.Maybe ""Raised on Rock"" should be the next Elvis remix candidate.

Reichenberg met Nikolaus Harnoncourt, director of Concentus Musicus Wien. Reichenberg became increasingly interested in playing the oboe's repertoire on the instrument for which it had been written and, with the assistance of Harnoncourt, moved to Vienna in order to study baroque oboe with Jürg Schäftlein. He simultaneously studied oboe making with Paul Hailperin, building the instrument upon which he played for four years.

Let me give you an example: For four years we have waited expectantly for the pitter patter of tiny paws. Soon, that wait could finally be over. Tian Tian, the UK's only female giant panda, has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August. However Edinburgh Zoo, where the pandas live, have warned people 'not to get too excited' as the process is 'extremely complex'. Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August. She has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at £600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years
The answer to this example can be: Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.

"You are given a passage. You need to construct a question about the information present in the passage. Construct a question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) its answer is the whole paragraph. Avoid creating questions that can be answered correctly without actually understanding the paragraph.
One example is below.
Q: Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly
capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a
DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect
imperfections in the underlying surface and
determine motion. Some materials, such as glass,
mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces
interfere with the ability of the DSP to
accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.
\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the
mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in
the underlying surface to determine motion.
Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they
constantly reflect back the same image, causing
the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the
system is unable to see surface changes associated
with movement, the mouse will not work properly.
A: why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass

"Rewrite each original sentence in order to make it easier to understand by non-native speakers of English. You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentences need to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of their original counterparts without altering their meanings.

"HANNOVER, Germany -- Germany maintained the pressure on the Czech Republic in the race for top spot in Group D with a comfortable 4-0 win against Cyprus in Hannover. Lukas Podolski celebrates his goal as Germany cruised to a 4-0 victory over Cyprus. Both sides have already qualified for EURO 2008 but Germany showed no sign of letting up as Bayern Munich pair Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski struck either side of half-time to build on Clemens Fritz's second-minute opener. Thomas Hitzlsperger added the fourth in the 82nd minute as Germany claimed their eighth win in the group to move level with the Czech Republic on 26 points. Germany were quick out of the blocks and celebrated their first goal after less than 120 seconds. Podolski's determination paid off and he pulled the ball back from the goalline for Fritz to score with a far-post header. Klose added the second on 20 minutes, accepting a pass from the selfless Fritz in a central position and firing in from eight meters out. Podolski was Germany's main threat, and he finally got the goal an excellent performance warranted when he turned in Klose's low cross from the right eight minutes into the second half. The impressive Podolski turned provider for the final goal eight minutes from time, making a determined run to the goalline before squaring for Hitzlsperger, whose simple tap-in completed the scoring. Meanwhile, Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky was among the goals for the Czech Republic as they beat neighbors Slovakia 3-1 in Prague to remain top of the group by virtue of their head-to-head with Germany. Germany conclude their qualifying campaign at home to Wales on Wednesday while the Czech Republic travel to Cyprus. Meanwhile, the Netherlands secured their place in the finals with a narrow 1-0 win over Luxembourg in Group G. Danny Koevermans scored the only goal for the Dutch two minutes before half time to seal their place in the finals alongside Romania -- who remain top of the group having already qualified, despite losing 1-0 to Bulgaria in Sofia. Spain beat Sweden 3-0 with goals by Joan Capdevila, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Ramos, while Northern Ireland maintained their slim chance of catching Sweden by beating Denmark 2-1. David Healy scored the winning goal to set a European Championship qualifying record of 13 goals, overtaking Davor Suker's 12-goal mark.

The Marine wrapped his toughened fingers around the old man's weak ones, expressing a message of love and encouragement. The nurse brought a chair so that the Marine could sit beside the bed. All through the night the young Marine sat there in the poorly lighted ward , holding the old man's hand and offering him words of love and strength. Occasionally, the nurse suggested that the Marine move away and rest a while. He refused. Now and then she heard him say a few gentle words. The dying man said nothing, only holding tightly to his son all through the night. Along towards dawn, the old man died. The Marine released the now lifeless hand he had been holding and went to tell the nurse. While she did what she had to do, he waited. Finally, she returned. She started to offer words of sympathy, but the Marine interrupted her.""Who was that man?""he asked. The nurse was surprised. ""He was your father,""she answered.

"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: My school stood in a big square playground in southeastern South Dakota. One teacher taught all grades, first through eighth. Most grades had only two or three students. Our school day started with the flag pledge . Then the teacher called one grade at a time to the recitation bench beside her desk. She'd check our work, explain the new lesson, and dismiss us to go back to our own desks and do our new work, all in less than ten minutes per grade. At noon we ate lunches we had brought. Our lunches consisted of homemade sandwiches and if we were lucky, dessert. My favorite dessert was a fresh pear, and a piece of Mom's delicious sour cream chocolate cake. The annual Christmas program was the most exciting part of the year. We hurried through our lessons during December to allow time to practise poems, songs, and plays. A few days before the performance, the school board members borrowed equipment from the town and set up a stage across one side of the classroom. We hung bed sheets for curtains. On the evening of the performance, petrol lanterns hanging along the walls cast a warm, though not very bright, light over the gathering crowd. We could hardly contain our excitement as we looked from behind the curtains to wave at our parents. On a spring Sunday in a new term, just before the last day of the school term, everyone in the neighborhood gathered for a picnic. Our moms set fried chicken, bowls of salads, and desserts on the teacher's desk and the library table. After the dinner, we played games. One of the school board members brought big buckets of ice cream in the afternoon to top off the picnic. How we looked forward to that treat! I was just nineteen years old when I started my first teaching position in a country school with thirteen students. I felt excited, nervous and happy as I prepared my lunch bucket the first morning of the term. I can't remember what kind of sandwiches I packed, but I do remember I put in a fresh pear and a piece of chocolate cake for dessert!

I should reach my destination no later than 2 hours after the promised arrival time.  US Airways consistently challenges those three requirements.    Let's start with connections; the connections are quite compressed, like 30 minutes.  That is unreasonable and leaves no room for error.  If you miss the connecting flight then it is nearly impossible to get on the next flight because it is booked, in fact overbooked.  I have missed my connection multiple times due tight scheduling by US Airways.  As for the middle seat, let's just say that is pure torture to me.  US Airways charges you for an aisle or a window, even in economy.  Lame.  I am now trained to pay for exit row or the 'plus' sections on other carriers, but US Airways has taken this to a whole new level of stinginess and revenue generation.  Booh!  Usually if I am within 2 hours of my expected arrival time I can recover.  Whether it is catching up on rest, rescheduling a meeting, grabbing a late dinner, 2 hours seems to be a reasonable delay - I told you my expectations are low!  US Airways has only achieved a 50% success rate and that is an F in absolute terms and at best a D if you grade on the generous airline curve.  US Airways is definitely not my first choice.

"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be given a food review in Persian. You have to Classify the sentiment of the reviewer toward the food into: ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", and ""mixed"". The mixed category indicates reviews where none of the sentiments are dominant (mix of positive and negative, or borderline cases); hence it is hard to detect the primary sentiment. Also, assign neutral label to reviews that express no clear sentiment toward an entity or any aspect of it.

My answer: This is the relevant information: The tallest U.S. President was Abraham Lincoln at 6 feet 4 inches (193 centimeters), while the shortest was James Madison at 5 feet 4 inches (163 centimeters). The answer is James Madison at 5 feet 4 inches ( 163 centimeters ).

Quick Question: When a motor neuron generates an action potential, it travels rapidly along the nerve until it reaches the neuromuscular junction, where it initiates an electrochemical process that causes acetylcholine to be released into the space between the presynaptic terminal and the muscle fiber. The acetylcholine molecules then bind to nicotinic ion-channel receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing the ion channels to open. Calcium ions then flow into the muscle cell, initiating a sequence of steps that finally produce muscle contraction.

Answer this question: where is acetylcholine released from to stimulate muscle contraction?
My answer: The relevant information is: When a motor neuron generates an action potential, it travels rapidly along the nerve until it reaches the neuromuscular junction, where it initiates an electrochemical process that causes acetylcholine to be released into the space between the presynaptic terminal and the muscle fiber. The answer is the neuromuscular junction.

"Please answer the following question: Background: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain.  Paragraph: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick.  He gets a bucket of water and says to him ""I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out"". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle.
